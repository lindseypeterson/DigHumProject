Abstract: The dataset for this project comes from the Civil War and Reconstruction Governors of Mississippi Project (CWRGM), a digital documentary edition of 22,000 letters written to the Governors of Mississippi during the Civil War and Reconstruction (1859â€“1882). Originally housed at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, CWRGM is digitizing, transcribing, and annotating these documents with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, and the Watson-Brown Foundation. As of June 2024, the site has made 11,835 documents freely available online at cwrgm.org. The CWRGM collection is far less about the governors, and more about the hopes, frustrations, and fears of ordinary Americans during one of the most tumultuous times in American history. The collection features documents written from nearly every constituency imaginable during the era, including enlisted men, Unionists, veterans, women, and after April 1865, African Americans. Consequently, it is a rich repository of letters, telegrams, petitions, and rations pertaining to African American history, especially the process through which emancipation and freedom was fought for and secured.
